# Sea_Ice_Concentration_Estimation_Using_CNNs

This is a research project about Sea Ice SAR Imagery.

## The defination of sea ice concentration
The percentage of sea ice coverage in a given sea area is defined as sea ice concentration, or ice concentration(IC), ranging from 0\% to 100\%. Therefore, this is regression problem

## The ground truth 
Image analysis charts from Canadian ice service

## Input data
SAR Images in HH polarization and HV polarization and Incidence angle data

## Output data:
predicted sea ice concentration for pixels in SAR images
